# vue-calendar

This is a simple project for practicing Vue.js. I’m not using any AI agent tools (such as Claude Code or GitHub Copilot) to build this project. AI is only used to help search for solutions when I encounter problems and to ask for suggestions on common architecture questions, especially those related to Vue.js.

Feel free to clone the repository.

**Developer murmur: No plan for RWD because it's a side project and I don't wanna put too much effort on supporting different resolution, please forgive me.**
